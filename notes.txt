new lambda function to update a json, and not a list.  use logic to match email and update the json object if exsist and add if not.  return the updated json object.


2 options we may need a second lambda we may be able to fold the logic...need to test update in s3.

We need to also include some error handling and verification the object is in the correct format.


3rd party api email validation.
