      <h2>Privacy Policy for Hackathon Registration</h2>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2024</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how C.D. Tech ("we", "us", "our") collects,

      </p>

      <h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <p>
        We collect your email address when you register for the hackathon. This
        information is necessary for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acting as a headcount approximation for the event organizer.</li>
        <li>Communicating important event details and updates.</li>
        <li>Sending pre-event and post-event materials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Use of Information</h3>
      <p>Your email address will be used for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Event-related communication: Updates, schedules, and other essential
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Post-event follow-up: Feedback surveys, announcements, and community
          engagement opportunities.
        </li>

        The collected email addresses will be securely stored in an Amazon Web
        Services (AWS) S3 bucket.
      </p>
      <p>
        The S3 bucket will be destroyed, and all email addresses will be deleted
        after the event, except for the organizer's retention of the email list
        for ongoing communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your
